# password-Generator

## Description
This Python script is a simple and customizable password generator. It allows users to generate a secure password with a combination of numbers, symbols, and letters. The password is then saved to a local log file with the username and the platform the password was generated for. This project helps automate the creation of strong passwords and manage them securely.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Length**: Specify the number of numbers, symbols, and letters you want in your password.
- **Password Generation**: Randomly selects characters from predefined sets (numbers, symbols, and letters).
- **Shuffling**: After generating the password, the characters are shuffled to ensure randomness.
- **Password Logging**: Saves the generated password with the associated platform and username in a text file (`password_logs.txt`).
- **Platform Support**: You can specify the platform (e.g., "Facebook", "Twitter", etc.) for which the password is being created.
